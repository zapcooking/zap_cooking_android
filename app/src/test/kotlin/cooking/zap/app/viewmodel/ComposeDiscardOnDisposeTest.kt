/**
 * Pure gate for the composer's discard-on-dispose decision ([shouldDiscardOnDispose]). This is
 * the crux of the phantom-draft fix's PR 2: emptying a restored draft and leaving must discard it,
 * but the trigger has to be narrow — a blank reply composer or an un-restored composer must never
 * wipe the cache. The live path (LastDraftCache prefs + relay replacement) needs Android and is
 * exercised on-device; the DECISION is pure and tested here.
