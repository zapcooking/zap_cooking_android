/**
 * The blank-line pass in [parseContent]: surplus blank lines inside a post's prose.
 *
 * A post padded with blank lines, or paragraphs split by three or more newlines,
 * rendered every extra newline as a real empty line — a gap the reader can't
 * collapse and the author usually didn't ask for. One blank line is the paragraph
 * break and survives; single newlines are always left alone.
 *
 * The block-adjacency case (blank lines hugging an image / invoice / embed) is the
 * preceding pass's job and isn't covered here. Ported from wisp-ios
 * ContentParser pass 6.
