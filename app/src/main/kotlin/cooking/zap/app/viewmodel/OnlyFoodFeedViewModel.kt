/**
 * OnlyFood 🍳 — a kind-1 social food feed over the expanded [FoodHashtags] set
 * (concern 1.6). Modes (v1): [Mode.GLOBAL] and [Mode.FOLLOWING] (server-side
 * `authors` filter from the kind-3 contacts). Members + replies deferred.
 * Filtering is mute-only (matches the web + `HashtagFeedViewModel`).
 *
 * **Per-mode cache — DON'T re-query on toggle.** `search.nostrarchives.com`
 * rate-limits repeated queries per connection: the first identical query
 * returns ~99 events, a repeat ~12s later returns 0. So each mode is queried
 * **once** and its results cached in a [ModeState]; toggling [setMode] swaps
 * the visible list to the target mode's cache **instantly, with no relay
 * query**. The only path that re-queries a loaded mode is explicit
 * [refresh] (pull-to-refresh). A mode that legitimately returns 0 still gets
 * `loaded = true`, so it isn't re-queried (and re-throttled) on every toggle.
 *
 * Churn hygiene (less throttle pressure): all loads serialize through one
 * [submit] that `cancelAndJoin`s the previous job first, and teardown CLOSEs
 * only the subIds actually opened.
