     * [identifier] and [publishedAt] are both **null on create** — the emitted
     * tags are then byte-identical to the web's, `published_at` is omitted
     * exactly as the web omits it, and `d` is `slug(title)`. Both are set on

     * would publish a second recipe instead of replacing the first), and
     * `published_at` must be written back from the original or the parser's
     * `created_at` fallback re-dates the recipe to the edit time. The asymmetry
     * is the design, not a compromise — create's output does not change.

     * `title`, and that is load-bearing: [RecipeParser.deriveCategories]
     * excludes exactly `"<root>-<dTag>"`. Derive it from a retitled recipe's new
     * title and the two stop matching, so the self-tag survives that filter and
     * renders as a category chip named after the recipe itself, on the recipe
     * screen and in every category feed.
