     *
     * That is deliberately **not** "the relays the recipe was published to."
     * Nothing here can reach a relay we no longer write to, so a recipe first
     * published from the web, or from this account before its relay list
     * changed, can keep serving its old version somewhere this edit never
     * touches. A replacement is only as complete as the relay set it lands on,

     *
     * What it does reach is wider than the create paths' worst case: `30023` is
     * in [PANTRY_MIRROR_KINDS], so [broadcast] mirrors the replacement to
     * [RelayConfig.MEMBERS_RELAY] too. Propagating furthest is not the same as
     * propagating far enough.
     *
     * Images are already hosted (same contract as the manual compose publish
     * above) — no re-host.
     *
     * The address is not re-derived from the (possibly changed) title; it comes
     * off [original] inside the format's `serializeEdit`, which is also what
     * carries over the tags the model does not represent.
     *
     * Serialized by **[original]'s own format**, not [RecipeFormats.primary]: an
     * edit replaces a specific event, and re-encoding it into a different format
     * would leave the original live at its own address rather than replacing it.
     * Those are the same object today and this is what keeps them from having to
     * be.
     *
     * Only the author may edit — the same reason [delete] refuses: an event
     * signed by anyone else replaces nothing, because a replaceable address is
     * `(kind, pubkey, d)`. Refused here rather than published, so the publisher
     * is never the one to sign an event that cannot do what the screen said.
