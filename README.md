## Why Zap Cooking

Most Nostr clients treat relays as interchangeable dumb pipes and lean on a small handful of "mega-relays." Zap Cooking takes a different approach — it implements the full outbox/inbox relay model with reliability scoring, routes messages based on where users actually publish and read, and is built so that decentralization is the default path, not an opt-in.

The result is faster event delivery, less wasted bandwidth, and a client that actively reinforces the architecture Nostr was designed for. Zap Cooking is built to be fast, lightweight, and respectful of both your device and the relay network.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Outbox/Inbox Relay Routing

Zap Cooking implements a full NIP-65 outbox/inbox model with relay scoring:

- **Outbox reads** — fetches a user's posts from their *write relays* (where they actually publish), not from a hardcoded list
- **Inbox writes** — delivers replies, reactions, and mentions to the recipient's *read relays* so they actually see them
- **Relay scoring** — `RelayScoreBoard` tracks reliability and author coverage per relay to pick the smallest useful set for each query
- **Smart relay hints** — when tagging events, chooses hints that overlap the author's outbox with the target's inbox for best discoverability
- **Persistent + ephemeral pool** — `RelayPool` maintains up to 30 persistent connections plus up to 50 short-lived ephemeral ones, with idle cleanup and per-relay cooldowns after failures
- **NIP-42 authentication** — signs AUTH challenges only for relays the user has explicitly approved, with persisted approvals, and waits for AUTH before sending sensitive publishes (DMs, group events)
- **NIP-11 relay info** — fetches and respects relay metadata, capabilities, and limitations

### Privacy & Private Messaging

- **NIP-17 gift-wrap DMs** — three-layer privacy model (rumor → seal → gift wrap) with timestamp randomization
- **NIP-44 modern encryption** — ECDH + HKDF + XChaCha20 + HMAC-SHA256, with aggressive conversation-key caching (ECDH is expensive; cache it per peer)
- **NIP-04 fallback** — legacy encrypted DMs still read for backward compatibility
- **Dedicated DM relays** — publish DMs to a separate relay set (NIP-51 kind 10050) from your public posts
- **Encrypted media** — optional encrypted image attachments in DMs

### Lightning & Zaps

A built-in non-custodial Lightning wallet powered by [Breez SDK (Spark)](https://github.com/breez/breez-sdk-spark), plus NWC as an alternative:

- **Embedded Spark wallet** — self-custodial Lightning node that runs on-device
- **12-word seed backup** — standard BIP-39 mnemonic recovery
- **Encrypted relay backup** — wallet credentials encrypted to your own pubkey (NIP-44) and published as a NIP-78 app-data event (kind 30078) so you can restore from any session; format-compatible with other Spark wallets
- **NWC (NIP-47)** — connect any `nostr+walletconnect://` compatible wallet as an alternative
- **Lightning address** — configure a reusable LN address for receiving
- **Transaction history** — paginated, with counterparty resolution from zap receipts
- **Zaps** — send (NIP-57), display zap receipts on the feed, and vote in **zap polls** (NIP-69)
- **QR scanning** — scan or import to pay invoices

### Safety & Content Filtering

- **nspam ML classifier** — on-device LightGBM spam model with MurmurHash3 feature hashing; filters out low-quality content without sending anything off-device
- **Social graph filtering** — optional "follows + follows-of-follows" scope built from an on-device social graph database
- **Mute lists** (NIP-51 kind 10000) for blocking pubkeys, synced via Nostr
- **Keyword muting** for content filtering
- **Blocked relays** (NIP-51 kind 10006) to opt out of specific relays entirely
- All safety lists sync across clients via published Nostr events

### Rich Content Types

- **Notes & long-form articles** — NIP-01 short notes and NIP-23 articles (kind 30023), with full reader view
- **Picture posts** (NIP-68, kind 20) and **video posts** (NIP-71, kinds 21/22) with imeta parsing, blurhash, thumbnails, and fallback mirrors
- **Live streams** (NIP-53, kind 30311) — watch and chat on live activities
- **Polls** (NIP-88, kinds 1068/1018) — create and vote on single- or multiple-choice polls
- **Reposts** (NIP-18) with tracking
- **Emoji reactions** (NIP-25) with **custom emoji packs** (NIP-30)
- **Reply threading** (NIP-10) with root resolution and marked e-tags
- **Drafts** (NIP-37, kind 31234) — save unfinished posts to your relays so they follow you across devices
- **Proof-of-work** (NIP-13) — optional PoW mining with configurable difficulty, coroutine-cancellable

### Groups & Communities

- **NIP-29 relay-based groups** — join, browse, chat (kind 9), manage membership, with metadata and admin/member addressable events
- **Group persistence** — joined groups and recent messages are cached locally (ObjectBox) so rooms open instantly
- Group event AUTH gating — group joins, creates, and invites (9021/9007/9009) wait for NIP-42 AUTH before sending, and surface admin failures

### Media & Storage

- **Blossom** — upload images and media to decentralized [Blossom](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom) servers
- Per-account Blossom server list (kind 10063)
- Nostr-event-based upload auth (kind 24242)
- Multi-server fallback — tries each configured server until one succeeds

### Performance

- **LRU caches** across events (5,000), profiles, reactions, reposts, and zaps — data is fetched once and reused
- **Selective on-device persistence** — ObjectBox stores only the kinds worth keeping warm (notes, articles, media posts, zap receipts, polls, reactions, reposts, profiles) for fast cold-start; everything else stays in RAM
- **Off-main-thread processing** — event parsing, crypto, and relay I/O all run on background dispatchers
- **Frame-debounced UI updates** — feed emissions are coalesced to one per ~16 ms frame, preventing recomposition storms from bursty relay traffic
- **Atomic dedup** — check-then-put guards so the same event never gets processed twice across relays
- **Lazy metadata fetching** — profiles are batched and swept periodically rather than fetched per-event
- **Relay cooldowns** — failed relays get a 5-minute cooldown before retry, preventing connection storms
- **Cancellable PoW mining** — honors coroutine cancellation so cancelled mines release the CPU immediately

### Identity, Keys & Accounts

- **Multiple accounts** with per-account encrypted storage
- **EncryptedSharedPreferences** (AES256-GCM) for private keys — `nsec` never touches plain SharedPreferences
- **Biometric authentication** for key access
- **NIP-19 bech32** — npub, nsec, note, nevent, nprofile encode/decode, with `nostr:` URI rendering in post content
- **NIP-05 DNS verification** with result caching
- **QR code display** for sharing keys and profiles

### Additional Features

- **Thread view** with full NIP-10 root/reply resolution
- **Notifications** aggregating mentions, reactions, zaps, and reposts
- **Hashtag feeds** and hashtag following
- **Search** for profiles, content, and hashtags
- **Bookmarks** and **pins** (NIP-51), plus custom **follow sets** (kind 30000) as alternative feed sources
- **Relay console and health view** for debugging relay communication
- **Profile editing** with metadata publishing
- **Onboarding flow** — key creation, topic/interest selection, and follow suggestions for new users
- **Translation** of foreign-language posts
- **Fiat conversion** of sats for zaps and balances

### Key Design Decisions

- **Mostly in-memory, selectively persistent** — the bulk of state lives in LRU caches; ObjectBox persists a narrow set of kinds (notes, articles, media posts, reactions, reposts, zap receipts, polls, profiles) plus joined groups, so cold starts are fast without the complexity of a full event store. Preferences live in SharedPreferences; private keys live in EncryptedSharedPreferences.
- **NIP objects** — each NIP is implemented as a Kotlin `object` with pure helper functions (e.g., `Nip17.createGiftWrap()`, `Nip44.encrypt()`), making the protocol layer modular and easy to test.
- **Flow-based reactivity** — SharedFlow for relay events, StateFlow for UI state. No RxJava, no LiveData — pure coroutines.
- **Signer abstraction** — `NostrSigner` is an interface; this fork ships only `LocalSigner`, which holds the key on-device. Amber / NIP-55 remote signing was removed: `SigningMode` is `LOCAL`/`READ_ONLY` only, and read-only accounts cannot sign.
- **Off-main-thread crypto** — all signing, NIP-44 encryption, and PoW mining run on `Dispatchers.Default` with proper cancellation support.
- **Encrypted key storage** — private keys use AES256-GCM via Android's Security Crypto library, never plain SharedPreferences.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Android 8.0 (API 26) or higher
- A Nostr keypair (generate one in-app, or import an existing `nsec`)

### Installation

APK downloads are available on the [Releases](../../releases) page.

### First Launch

1. **Create or import a key** — generate a fresh keypair or paste your `nsec`
2. **Set up your profile** — the onboarding flow walks you through name, picture, and bio
3. **Pick some interests** — topic/interest selection seeds your first follow suggestions
4. **Follow some people** — Zap Cooking suggests popular accounts to get your feed started
5. **Configure relays** — your relay list is published as a NIP-65 event so other outbox-aware clients can find you

---

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) Ladybug or later
- JDK 17
- Android SDK 35

### Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zapcooking/zap_cooking_android.git
cd zap_cooking_android

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on a connected device
./gradlew installDebug

# Build release APK (R8-minified)
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

Release builds use R8 minification; keep rules live in `app/proguard-rules.pro` and cover kotlinx.serialization, secp256k1 JNI, Bouncy Castle, OkHttp, Coil, Security Crypto, Media3, and ZXing.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Zap Cooking is open source and community help makes it better.

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your feature or fix (`feat/…`, `fix/…`, `refactor/…`, `docs/…`, `chore/…`, `perf/…`)
3. **Make your changes** — follow the existing code patterns and conventions
4. **Test** on a real device or emulator
5. **Commit** with a clear, descriptive message (`<type>: <summary>`)
6. **Open a pull request** against `main` — one concern per PR, small and focused

### Code Conventions

- **Kotlin** with Jetpack Compose — no XML layouts
- **NIP implementations** go in `NipXX.kt` as Kotlin `object` with static helper functions
- **Events** are created via `NostrEvent.create(privkey, pubkey, kind, content, tags)`, routed through the `NostrSigner` (`LocalSigner`) abstraction
- **Hex encoding** uses `ByteArray.toHex()` / `String.hexToByteArray()` extensions
- **Coroutines** for all async work — `Dispatchers.Default` for CPU-bound (crypto, PoW), `Dispatchers.IO` for network
- **StateFlow** for UI state, **SharedFlow** for relay events
- Keep functions small and focused. Prefer clarity over cleverness.

### Areas Where Help is Needed

- UI/UX polish and accessibility improvements
- Additional NIP implementations
- Unit and integration tests
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Translations and localization
- Documentation improvements

### Reporting Issues

[Open an issue](../../issues) with:

- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Device and Android version
- Relevant logs from the in-app relay console (if applicable)
